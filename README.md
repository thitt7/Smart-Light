## About The Project

This is a legacy project created circa 2018 that has since been optimized with simpler hardware and Node.js for the backend. It strives to create a simple 
but elegant webpage UI with the purpose of controlling a series of network connected LED's that run off of relays connected to a Raspberry Pi. This project 
was made with the Raspberry Pi Zero W in mind, but should be compatible with any Raspberry Pi that is running the WiringPi library. It works by hosting an 
apache server on the RPi that allows users on the local network to visit the webpage and execute commands on the RPi by using PHP for the backend.
